/**
 * 
 * Method 1 (Count 0s or 1s) Thanks to Naveen for suggesting this method. 1)
 * Count the number of 0s. Let count be C. 2) Once we have count, we can put C
 * 0s at the beginning and 1s at the remaining n â€“ C positions in array.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * 
 * The method 1 traverses the array two times. Method 2 does the same in a
 * single pass.
 * 
 * 
 * Method 2 (Use two indexes to traverse) Maintain two indexes. Initialize first
 * index left as 0 and second index right as n-1.
 * 
 * Do following while left < right a) Keep incrementing index left while there
 * are 0s at it b) Keep decrementing index right while there are 1s at it c) If
 * left < right then exchange arr[left] and arr[right]
 * 
 * Implementation:
 *
